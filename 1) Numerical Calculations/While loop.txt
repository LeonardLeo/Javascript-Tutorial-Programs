While Loop
A new useful type of loop for this challenge is the while loop:

while(b > 5) {
    // do something
}
Below you can see we are simply providing a condition true that this statement will execute until that condition is false.

Also helpful is the break statement:

while(true) {
    if(a > 2) {
        // exit the loop
        break;
    }
}
Once break is hit, we will exit the loop. Even though the condition is true the break statement still gives us a way to exit the loop.

 You can also exit a loop by using return, which will exit the function and return the value you designate.
