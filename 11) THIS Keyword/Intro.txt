This Keyword
In JavaScript, the this keyword provides a function with context.

A function may act different depending on what this is:

function logout() {
    if(this.isLoggedIn) {
        this.removeAuthToken();
        this.redirectToSignIn();
    }
}
As we'll learn in the Prototype Chain lesson, JavaScript has a powerful tool for creating new objects and linking them to a common function. These functions can be written once and applied to whatever this is.

// an example of a "constructor" function
// we'll explore this in further detail
function Person() {
    this.name = "Steve";
    this.age = 32;
}
Let's learn about the this keyword, the rules by which it's bound and how we can use those in our programs.
