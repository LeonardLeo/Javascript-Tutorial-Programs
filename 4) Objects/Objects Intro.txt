Objects
It's time to take a deeper look at another type of storage: object.

The object initializer syntax starts with an open curly-brace { and ends with a close curly-brace } with a list of key-value pairs in the middle. Let's take a look at a person object:

const person = {
    hairColor: 'brown',
    toes: 10,
    grumpy: true
}
 This object shows that we can use numbers, strings and booleans as values.

This person has "brown" hairColor, 10 toes and is grumpy, unfortunately. 

We can retrieve these values by key:

console.log( person.toes ); // 10
console.log( person.hairColor ); // brown
We can even store other objects as values! But let's not get carried away for now. 

Before we dive any deeper, let's jump into coding exercises!









PYTHON DICTIONARY vs JAVASCRIPT Objects
PYTHON:

store = {
    "Name": "Leonard",
    "Address": "33 Yetunde Morgan Estate",
    "Age": 25,
    "Mood": "Blessed",
    "Happy": True
}


JAVASRIPT:

const store = {
    Name: "Leonard",
    Address: "33 Yetunde Morgan Estate",
    Age: 25,
    Mood: "Blessed",
    Happy: false
}
